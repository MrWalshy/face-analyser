# Notes
- Local conda env face-detection holds scikit files and opencv + dependencies
- Should take any picture of a face/s

# How to run?
- Set up correct env, fullfill dependencies
- Run the following in the terminal:

        conda activate face-detection
        python main.py <image_path.format>

# Possible Future
- The ability to detect faces in images is powerful. So much so that I would like to incorporate the following features of computer vision technology:
    - Face detection is a computer vision tech. that can identify faces within digital images.
    - Facial recognition is used for biometric purposes, i.e. identification
    - Facial analysis trys determining properties describing a face, such as age, gender, emotion...
    - Facial tracking is used in video anaylsis, tracking the face + features(eyes, nose, lips) across the screen.
- A project involving my R-Pi could be good for learning here, I would need a camera module for an R-Pi facial-recognition security cam project.
